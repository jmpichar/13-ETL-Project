# Data

## Target variable:
    ### Crude mortality rate due to drug overdose per county in 2016.
    ## Breaking the data down per state only provides too few records
    ### Breaking down the over dose deaths by drug, e.g. heroin prescription opioids vs synthetic would also produce too few records.
        #### Deaths between 10-20 are reported as "unreliable" statistics.
        #### Deaths between 0-9 are not reported at all, because in small counties it woulld be easy to identify the individual.

## Independent variables:
    ### Demographic
        #### Race
        #### Education
        #### Median Target

    ### Income
        #### Median household Income
        #### % Poverty
        #### % Unemployment

    ### Medical
        #### Opioid prescription rate

    ### Geographic
        #### US Census regional division
